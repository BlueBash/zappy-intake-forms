- Chris D.: "Could be slightly warmer"

## Key Tone Principles Identified

### ✅ **What's Working:**
1. **Collaboration language** - "Let's", "we'll", "together"
2. **Acknowledgment** - "Thanks for sharing", "We appreciate"
3. **Em-dashes for warmth** - "we're listening—and here to help"
4. **Benefit-focused** - "This helps us..." explaining why
5. **"You" language** - Keeps focus on user benefit

### ⚠️ **What Needs Work:**
1. **Clinical jargon** - "screening", "assessment", "conditions"
2. **Demanding language** - "We need", "You must"
3. **Missing context** - Not explaining why we ask
4. **Lack of reassurance** - Especially in sensitive sections
5. **Formality in casual moments** - Could lighten up

## Tone Checklist for Every Screen

Before finalizing any question, ask:

- [ ] **Is it friendly?** Would you say this to a friend?
- [ ] **Is it trustworthy?** Does it explain why and protect privacy?
- [ ] **Is it casually professional?** Warm but not unprofessional?
- [ ] **Does it show empathy?** Especially for sensitive topics?
- [ ] **Does it reduce anxiety?** Reassure, don't alarm?
- [ ] **Does it focus on user benefit?** "Helps you" not just "helps us"?
