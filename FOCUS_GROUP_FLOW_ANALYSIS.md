## Round-Robin Analysis (10 Cycles)

### CYCLE 1: Initial Impressions

**Sarah:** "Three goal questions right at the start feels redundant. Can we combine motivations and challenges?"

**Mike:** "The state question comes too early. I don't know if I'm committing yet."

**Lisa:** "I like the friendly tone but worried about how long this will take."

**David:** "Auto-advance on single selects is confusing me - not sure when to click."

**Emma:** "On mobile, the composite screens with multiple fields feel cramped."

**James:** "Why am I answering motivations when I already know I want Wegovy?"

**Maria:** "Good to see HIPAA mentioned early, but it's after email capture."

**Tom:** "Can I see pricing before answering 50 questions?"

**Ashley:** "Love the educational content but it's slowing me down."

**Robert:** "Worried I'll get disqualified after investing 20 minutes."

### CYCLE 2: Qualification Phase Deep Dive

**Sarah:** "Weight goal questions (current, goal, highest) could be one screen."

**Mike:** "The BMI calculation screens feel like interruptions - can they be inline warnings?"

**Lisa:** "The visual.treatment_intro screen feels like filler before the graph."

**David:** "Do I need both 'Real Results' and graph screens? Feels repetitive."

**Emma:** "Email capture is good timing, but why the long thank you screen after?"

**James:** "Fast-path for returning customers? I'm already sold."

**Maria:** "HIPAA notice on thank you page is good but maybe too wordy."

**Tom:** "5 questions before I even see what this costs? Too many."

**Ashley:** "The weight loss graph is motivating but adds a click."

**Robert:** "Age and DOB questions feel redundant with each other."

### CYCLE 3: Health Assessment Scrutiny

**Sarah:** "Sex at birth and ethnicity on separate screens is slow. Combine?"

**Mike:** "Mental health composite is good but auto-advance on 'none' is smart."

**Lisa:** "Eating disorder questions are sensitive but well-handled."

**David:** "Substance use - three separate screens feels like an interrogation."

**Emma:** "The transition screens ('Almost through this section!') don't add value."

**James:** "Can skip most safety questions if I've used GLP-1s before."

**Maria:** "Medical conditions list is long - could group better?"

**Tom:** "Too many 'Are you sure?' type questions after selections."

**Ashley:** "Appreciate thorough health screening but it's exhausting."

**Robert:** "Worried about triggering exclusions - show me upfront what disqualifies."

### CYCLE 4: Medical History Focus

**Sarah:** "Diabetes → diabetes type → pregnancy is three screens. Consolidate?"

**Mike:** "Current medications screen → detail screen. Could be one with conditional."

**Lisa:** "Supplements and allergies are separate yes/no then detail. Repetitive pattern."

**David:** "Each question having its own screen makes this feel endless."

**Emma:** "On mobile, going back and forth between list and detail screens is tedious."

**James:** "Medical history could be 2-3 composite screens max."

**Maria:** "Like the granular approach but it's death by 1000 screens."

**Tom:** "Can I just upload my medical records? This is taking forever."

**Ashley:** "Activity level on its own screen? Really?"

**Robert:** "GLP-1 safety questions overlap with medical conditions. Redundant?"

### CYCLE 5: Treatment Selection Analysis

**Sarah:** "GLP-1 history screen is HUGE with all the checkboxes. Overwhelming."

**Mike:** "Love the detail capture but it could be a wizard instead of one massive form."

**Lisa:** "Do you have medication in mind? → Which one? → Plan. Could be one flow."

**David:** "If I say 'no preference', skip the medication selection entirely."

**Emma:** "The GLP-1 history form scrolls forever on mobile. Break it up?"

**James:** "I already told you I want Wegovy. Why ask again?"

**Maria:** "Medication preference feels like it has too many paths."

**Tom:** "JUST SHOW ME THE PRICE. Why is it so deep in the flow?"

**Ashley:** "Side effect plan interest is good but could be part of plan selection."

**Robert:** "Medication history is thorough but exhausting to fill out."

### CYCLE 6: Transition Screens Review

**Sarah:** "Every transition screen ('Nice work!', 'Almost there!') adds clicks."

**Mike:** "Transition screens are motivational but slow. Make them optional tooltips?"

**Lisa:** "I appreciate the encouragement but I'd rather just continue."

**David:** "Sometimes transition screens help me breathe. Mixed on this."

**Emma:** "On mobile, every extra screen is painful. Remove transitions."

**James:** "Skip all the cheerleading. I want to get this done."

**Maria:** "Transition screens give me time to think. Keep them?"

**Tom:** "DELETE ALL TRANSITION SCREENS. Pure waste of time."

**Ashley:** "Nice to have checkpoints but maybe just update a progress bar?"

**Robert:** "Transitions help me know I'm not stuck. Keep minimal ones."

### CYCLE 7: Composite Screen Effectiveness

**Sarah:** "Body measurements composite works great. More like this!"

**Mike:** "GLP-1 history composite is too ambitious. Split into medication cards?"

**Lisa:** "Composites with conditionals are confusing - fields appearing/disappearing."

**David:** "Simpler composites (2-3 fields) work. Complex ones overwhelm."

**Emma:** "Composites load slowly on mobile and feel janky."

**James:** "Checkout composite is good. Name, address, password - makes sense."

**Maria:** "Like seeing related fields together. Just don't overdo it."

**Tom:** "More composites = fewer clicks = FINALLY."

**Ashley:** "Composites are good when fields are actually related."

**Robert:** "Medical conditions as one composite would save so much time."

### CYCLE 8: Auto-Advance Opportunities

**Sarah:** "More auto-advance! Especially yes/no questions."

**Mike:** "Auto-advance on all single-selects with 2-4 options."

**Lisa:** "Auto-advance can feel jarring. Maybe add a small delay?"

**David:** "I don't like auto-advance. Feels like I'm losing control."

**Emma:** "Auto-advance is perfect for mobile. Less clicking."

**James:** "Auto-advance EVERYTHING possible. I'm here to get through this."

**Maria:** "Auto-advance worries me - what if I misclick?"

**Tom:** "Auto-advance or I'm rage-quitting this form."

**Ashley:** "Auto-advance on obvious choices (yes/no, 2 options) but not complex lists."

**Robert:** "Auto-advance on non-critical questions is fine."

### CYCLE 9: Progressive Disclosure Issues

**Sarah:** "Show/hide conditional fields is smart but delays are noticeable."

**Mike:** "Conditional display works but creates a lot of screen real estate shifts."

**Lisa:** "Sometimes I don't realize a field appeared. Better visual cues?"

**David:** "Confused when fields pop in. Make it more obvious?"

**Emma:** "Conditional fields on mobile cause layout jumps. Annoying."

**James:** "Progressive disclosure is fine but don't hide critical stuff."

**Maria:** "Like that I only see relevant questions. Good design."

**Tom:** "Just show me everything. Stop playing hide and seek."

**Ashley:** "Conditional display reduces overwhelm. Keep it."

**Robert:** "Helps me not see scary questions I can skip."

### CYCLE 10: Final Recommendations

**Sarah:** "Combine goal questions, consolidate medical history, reduce transitions."

**Mike:** "Create a 'returning customer' fast path. Skip safety if I qualified before."

**Lisa:** "Group related questions into smart composites. Show progress clearly."

**David:** "Keep auto-advance optional. Add 'Why we ask this' tooltips throughout."

**Emma:** "Optimize for mobile first. Reduce screens by 40%. More composites."

**James:** "Skip to plan selection if I've used GLP-1s. That's my qualifier."

**Maria:** "Privacy notice timing is good. Maybe add progress indicators in phases."

**Tom:** "Show pricing preview earlier. Let me filter by price before health screening."

**Ashley:** "Balance education with efficiency. Popups/tooltips vs separate screens."

**Robert:** "Show disqualification criteria upfront. Let me self-screen early."
