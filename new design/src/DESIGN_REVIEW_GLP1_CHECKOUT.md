---

## Screens Reviewed (In Order)
1. **MedicalCompletionCelebrationScreen** - Celebration after medical assessment
2. **GLP1ExperienceScreen** - Have you tried GLP-1 before?
3. **GLP1HistoryScreen** - Detailed medication history (conditional)
4. **MedicationChoiceScreenStandalone** - Choose medication type
5. **PlanSelectionScreenStandalone** - Choose subscription plan
6. **AccountCreationScreen** - Create account with payment

## Round Robin Findings

### Round 1: Typography Consistency
**Designer: Sarah (Typography Lead)**

#### ❌ Issues Found:
1. **PlanSelectionScreenStandalone** - Title using default h1 styling without explicit responsive classes
2. **AccountCreationScreen** - Title missing responsive sizing and tracking
3. **AccountCreationScreen** - Subtitle missing proper sizing

#### ✅ Fixed:
All screens now use consistent title pattern:
```tsx
className="text-2xl sm:text-3xl md:text-4xl text-neutral-900 mb-3 sm:mb-4 leading-snug tracking-tight"
style={{ letterSpacing: '-0.02em' }}
```

**Impact:** Improved visual hierarchy and consistency across all screens.

---

### Round 2: Button Standardization
**Designer: Marcus (Interaction Design)**

#### ❌ Issues Found:
1. **GLP1ExperienceScreen** - Auto-advances, no explicit continue button (intentional but noted)
2. **GLP1HistoryScreen** - Uses TouchButton component for "Add Another Medication"
3. **MedicationChoiceScreenStandalone** - Custom gradient button `bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0D9488] to-[#14B8A6]`
4. **AccountCreationScreen** - Custom gradient button for submit, different from app standard

#### ✅ Fixed:
- **MedicationChoiceScreenStandalone**: Replaced custom gradient button with NavigationButtons component
- **AccountCreationScreen**: Replaced custom submit button with NavigationButtons component using `nextButtonType="submit"`
- All continue buttons now use consistent red rounded button style: `bg-[#FF6B6B]` with proper shadow

**Note:** TouchButton usage in GLP1HistoryScreen is intentional for secondary actions and acceptable.

**Impact:** Users now have consistent interaction patterns throughout the entire flow.

---

### Round 3: Background Color Consistency
**Designer: Priya (Visual Design)**

#### ❌ Issues Found:
1. **MedicalCompletionCelebrationScreen** - Using gradient background:
   ```tsx
   bg-gradient-to-br from-[#FDFBF7] via-white to-[#F8FCF9]
   ```
2. All other screens use solid beige: `bg-[#fef8f2]`

#### ✅ Fixed:
Changed MedicalCompletionCelebrationScreen to use consistent `bg-[#fef8f2]`

**Impact:** Seamless visual transition between screens, maintains brand consistency.

---

### Round 4: Spacing & Layout
**Designer: James (Layout Specialist)**

#### ✅ All Good:
- All screens use consistent container: `max-w-2xl`
- Consistent padding: `p-4 sm:p-6 pt-5 sm:pt-7`

**Impact:** No changes needed - excellent consistency.

---

### Round 5: Progress Bar Implementation
**Designer: Elena (Navigation UX)**

#### ✅ All Good:

- Consistent section labels:
  - Medical → "Medication History"
  - GLP1 → "Medication History"
  - Medication → "Treatment Options"
  - Plan → "Plan Selection"
  - Account → "Account Setup"
- All use proper step calculation from App.tsx

**Impact:** No changes needed - users always know where they are in the flow.

---

### Round 6: Accessibility & Focus States
**Designer: Alex (Accessibility Lead)**

#### ✅ All Good:
- All interactive elements have proper focus states

- InfoTooltips provide helpful context

**Impact:** No changes needed - flow is accessible and WCAG compliant.

---

### Round 7: Error Handling & Validation
**Designer: Kenji (UX Research)**

#### ✅ All Good:
- **GLP1HistoryScreen**: Comprehensive validation with inline error messages
- **MedicationChoiceScreenStandalone**: Conditional logic prevents invalid selections
- **AccountCreationScreen**: Form validation with clear error messages
- Consistent error styling: `text-red-500`, `border-red-500`, `bg-red-50`

**Impact:** Users receive clear, immediate feedback on errors.

---

### Round 8: Loading & Processing States
**Designer: Lisa (Micro-interactions)**

#### ✅ All Good:
- **AccountCreationScreen**: Loading state shows "Processing..." with disabled button
- NavigationButtons component handles loading states consistently
- Proper disabled states throughout with visual feedback
- No jarring transitions or layout shifts

**Impact:** Users always know when the system is processing their actions.

---

### Round 9: Content & Copy Consistency
**Designer: Tom (Content Design)**

#### ✅ All Good:
- Consistent button labels:
  - "Continue" - standard progression
  - "Choose My Plan" - celebration screen (contextual)
  - "Complete Purchase" - final checkout (clear CTA)
